# how is this fork different?

- added dark theme (set `ui.web.dark` to true)
- advanced plugin parsing (see the `example.py` plugin file; you can add dependencies, default-config, assets and min-pwnagotchi version)
- removed peer/inbox functionality
- only refresh screen when needed (didnt rly work before)
- create a new model if the old one is broken (never fails to go AI)
- bug fixes
